# Contributing

So you want to contribute? Yay, I really appreciate this! Please read
the following notes to make life easy for both you and me.

Please note: This is the first version of a contributor guide. I don't
know whether this will work ;-)

## Did you find a bug?

1. Please check the [issues on
	 github](https://github.com/gonium/gosdm630/issues) if the bug was
	 already reported. If so: feel free to add a comment if you think it
	 helps.

2. Not previously reported? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/gonium/gosdm630/issues). Please describe how I can reproduce the issue (what environment, commandline parameters, attached devices, ...).

## Do you want to contribute code?
For small changes (typos etc.), just open a pull request. For anything
bigger, please open an issue first. Describe what you want to do
(bugfix, implement new feature, solve existing issue) and give a quick
overview on how you would like to implement it. I hope to reduce
frustration for both you and me if we agree on a solution strategy
before writing code.

In any way: Your code should be [formatted using
``gofmt``](https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code).

## Do you want to contribute documentation?

All documentation lives within this repository. If you spot an error or
want to improve the documentation, please create a pull request. For
small changes just create the pull request directly. For big changes
("This sucks, I want to rewrite it") create an issue first.
