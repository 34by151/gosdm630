# A HTTP interface to the SDM630-modbus smart meter

## Installation

You need the [GB](http://getgb.io/) build tool in order to compile your binary. First, get
it:

    go get github.com/constabulary/gb/...

Afterwards you clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/gonium/gosdm630.git

and build it:

    gb build all

Now, there should be a binary in the ````bin```` subfolder.
